        How to edit a template

Transferring content between Manychat accounts is incredibly helpful, whether you're cloning your account or copying specific automations to another account you own. But what if you need to share your entire Manychat setup with a client or a community? Imagine including everything — Tags, Custom User Fields, Actions, and more. With templates, now you can!

Templates are the ultimate tool for sharing ideas and strategies with students, clients, or your community. They allow you to back up and replicate successful workflows, seamlessly manage content across accounts, and even provide ready-made solutions for client management. Whether you're teaching, collaborating, or simply streamlining your processes, templates make it easy to share and scale your work.

In this article, we'll walk you through the process of creating, sharing, and installing templates to maximize your Manychat experience.

 
How to create a template

To start, navigate to My Profile > My Templates:

 

Select the New Template button to begin the setup:

 

Choose the account you want to base your template on:

 

Now, start choosing the elements to include in your template. You can create a template to share your entire account, a specific marketing campaign, or even a curated collection of keywords. Whether small or comprehensive, your template can be tailored to suit your needs.

 
PRO and free templates

If you add any PRO elements or exceed the free limit for other elements, then your template becomes a PRO-only feature and can only be installed on PRO accounts.

 
Adding an element to a template

Adding an element to a template automatically includes all its connected elements.
For instance, if you select an automation that contains an Open Automation step, the connected automation will also be included in the template. These linked automations will be added as inactive by default — you can exclude them by deactivating or modifying the parent element.

 
Manychat AI-powered templates

Manychat elements are offered as an add-on, requiring a separate subscription for activation. This add-on is exclusively available for PRO accounts.

When you've completed the setup, click Next to proceed.

 

You have two options:

    Within the Installed Template section (Settings > Installed Templates)

    In the account’s Bot Fields section (Settings > Fields > Bot Fields)

 
Bot Fields in the installed templates

When creating a template, you can decide where the Bot Fields included in your template will be stored:

 
Elements with invalid content

Elements highlighted in red typically indicate that they require republishing to become valid. If the automation was imported from another account, you might also need to re-upload any associated media content.

 

Let’s continue! Start by naming your template and selecting an avatar:

 

You can protect your template from being copied or recreated by enabling the Protect Template option.

 

Additionally, this feature allows you to:

    Restrict editing and viewing access to your template.
    Enable the Remove Control option to track who has installed your template. This option can be disabled at any time for specific installations.

 

Once everything is configured to your preferences, click the Create The Template button to save it:

 

You will be redirected to the success page with the template installation link:

 

Use the Permanent Link option to generate a permanent link, or select a Single-use link to share it with just one account. The single-use link expires after the first installation and can only be generated by the template owner. You can manage the link type directly on the template page.

 

⚠️Note: If you change the link type to Protected, your permanent link will remain inactive until you switch it back.

 
Editing template preferences

You can also edit template preferences, accessible later from the Templates section. Here, you can add a custom description and include links to installation guides. If left empty, users will see predefined instructions and guides by default. If you plan to share this template with others, it's a good idea to provide a detailed description of its contents. This ensures clarity for the recipient.

 
How to edit a template

Awesome! Your template is now live and accessible from the Templates section. To make changes, select your template and click the Edit Template button in the upper-right corner. This allows you to add more content, enable or disable the public access link, or delete the template entirely.

 

Confirm all your changes to update the template, and you're all set!
